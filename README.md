# FISH shell configuration

This repo is a git submodule for the main [dotfiles][dotfiles-repo] repository.
Although it can be used independently of it, I recommend checkup the code and information about installing dependencies, as well as applying it via [GNU Stow][gnu-stow]

## Dependencies

* [fisher][fisher] - A plugin manager for Fish
* [fzf][fzf] - A command-line fuzzy finder
* [fd][fd] - A simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to `find`
* [asdf][asdf] - Extendable version manager with a huge database of supported plugins
* [zoxide][zoxide] - A smarter `cd` command
* [bat][bat] - A `cat` clone with wings.
* [direnv][direnv] - A directory environment manager
